                <h2>ExtraBar 1.1.9 – Organize Like Never Before! 📁✨</h2>

                <h3>✨ What's New & Improved</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Actions Folders:</strong> Group your actions together into folders for a cleaner, more organized menu bar! Perfect for keeping related actions in one place and reducing clutter!</li>
                    <li><strong>Apps Folders:</strong> Create a single menu bar item that contains multiple apps, each with its own set of actions! One icon, endless possibilities – your workflows just got a whole lot neater!</li>
                    <li><strong>Action Widget:</strong> Trigger actions instantly without opening any menu! Create a menu bar item that executes an action with a single click – connect it to an app or use it as a custom standalone action!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>🚀 The Power of Customization</h3>
                <p>These three powerful features, combined with the presets from version 1.1.8, unlock the ultimate customization experience. Design your workflow exactly the way you want it – more efficient, more organized, and perfectly tailored to your needs!</p>

                <h3>🔮 What's Next?</h3>
                <p>The next few versions will focus on stability, UI/UX improvements, performance enhancements, and making existing features even more powerful and easier to use!</p>
