VERSION: 1.1.9
DETAILS:
We have added 3 main features that will give ExtraBar all the most requested features by you since we launched it:
1. Actions folders - you can now create folders for apps to group actions together
2. Apps Folders - You can create a item in the bar that will have multiple apps in it, each one with its own actions
3. Action widget - You can now create a menu item that will trigger event right away without any menu being open.
This action can be connected to an app or just custom action.

This 3 action togther with the presets from the previous version unlock fully customizing your workflow and making it more efficient and fit your needs.

The next few version will be focused on stability, UI UX, performance and make exsiting features more easier to use and more powerful.
